SaaS Customer Churn & Risk Analysis 📊
Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end Business Intelligence and Predictive Analytics solution to identify at-risk customers for a SaaS platform. This project bridges the gap between raw data science and actionable business insights by integrating Python-based machine learning with interactive Power BI dashboards.

Key Features
Predictive Modelling: Built and optimized Machine Learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to calculate churn probabilities.

Risk Segmentation: Implemented DAX measures to categorize over 240 users into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' risk groups.

Interactive Dashboards: Created dynamic visualizations in Power BI to track revenue-at-risk trends and customer satisfaction correlations.

Data Pipeline: Performed full EDA, data cleaning, and feature engineering using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn).

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost

Visualization: Power BI (DAX)

Tools: Git, JUPITER
